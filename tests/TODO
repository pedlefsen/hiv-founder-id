Testing for Ted: Make sure that running the pipeline on tawny yields identical results to what was obtained for the paper
- get permissions to file system
- figure out script location
- figure out dataset location
- figure out previous output location
- figure out where to put the data when I run it so that it does not override anything inportant.

Test the testing on tawny (or just my other computer?)
- Should I make a new repo with my fork's stuff?

Add in more tests for the pipeline:
- Drop the hypermutation flag
  - why are the 10 hypermutated sequences not getting flagged?
- Drop the recombination flag
  - RAP is down - get new RAPR wrapper from ted via paul
- Drop the pfitter flag

Write installation instructions:
  - git clone
  - phyml:
    - source dl
    - patch
    - build
    - symlink
