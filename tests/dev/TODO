Modify dev document to reflect the fact that it is an overall testing document and not specifically a test document. - this involves renaming and moving a couple of folders

Modify test document to _also_ read from the test_specs file. This is now called the bulk testing approach.

Add a script that builds the command scripts from the test_specs file:

* Add a check_freshness option to it
* Expand it to include the build script for the knitr document

Add function that checks specifications in dev_tests.Rmd against test_specs.csv

Remove all the hard coded stuff for my computer
  - The way to solve this is with the test_pipeline.R script that always eats a pipeline_dir argument

Write installation instructions:
  - git clone
  - phyml:
    - source dl
    - patch
    - build
    - symlink
