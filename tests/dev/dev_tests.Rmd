## Overview

This document is used to develop tests for the hiv-founder-id pipeline.

The basic testing procedure is:

1) Use a bash chunk to call the pipeline line with a call to perl specifying all the options, including the output directory. Testing output goes in tests/tmp/test_x folders
2) Check for the existence of the correct files and folders in tests/tmp/test_x against tests/ref_results/test_x.
3) If any files are missing, or if there are extra files, print out the names of the offending files.
4) Ensure that all the files are 'identical' - there might be timestamps etc that need to be ignored.
5) If any files are not identical, print out the names of the files that are not identical.
6) If the primery result file identify_founders.tab have mismatches, print out the column names that mismatch, as well as the values in the two files.

## The tests

### test_001

Run identify-founders.pl with the ld_seqs.fasta file and the absolute minimum options specified.

```{bash}
perl identify_founders.pl -CPRFHT -o tests/tmp/test_001 tests/data/ld_seqs.fasta 

```
