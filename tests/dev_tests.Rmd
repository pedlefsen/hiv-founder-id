## Overview

This document runs all the tests for the hiv-founder pipeline and presents the
results.

### Specifying tests

Tests are specified by listing:

* `c_test_name`: The name of the test -> `test_xxx` where xxx is a zero-padded
  integer.
* `fasta_file`: The name of the input file. This file must exists in the
  `tests/data` folder
* `command_flags`: The command flags passed to `identify-founders.pl`. Example:
  -CPR
* `test_description`: A very brief description of the test. Basically just an
  interpretation of the command flags.

These test specifications live in a csv file called `test_specs.csv` in the
tests folder. The last portion of this document also contains these
specifications and the two documents are checked against each other
automatically.

### Running a test

There is some weird thing that prevents the pipeline from running correctly
when called with a `system` call by `R`. The workaround is to write a bash
script into the `tests/commands` folder that runs the pipeline. These scripts
are produced in an automated fashion. If you run the `test_pipeline.R` script
in the tests folder with the flag `--build-command-scripts` then these scripts
will be produced. There is a `run_all.sh` script in the commands folder that
can be used to run all the tests.

### Steps in performing a test

Using the `run_all.sh` script, the user should run all the command files
related to the tests. This will execute all the command scripts in the commands
folder, running the pipeline for each test. The output from these runs will be
collected in `tests/tmp/test_xxx`. This step cannot be merged into an automated
testing approach because the pipeline does not play nice with R's `system`
command.

Next, the results produced in the `tests/tmp` folder is checked:

* The existance of the folder `tests/tmp/test_xxx` is checked.
* The dates of the files in this folder are inspected to ensure that the
  pipeline was run recently.
* A check is performed to ensure that all the files in `tests/ref/test_xxx` are
  present in `tests/tmp/test_xxx`.
* A check is performed to ensure that all the files in the `ref` and `tmp` are
  identical using md5 sums.
* The results of all checks are collected into a `data.frame` with the
  following columns:
  - `name`: The name of the check that was performed.
  - `result`: TRUE/FALSE indicating whether or not the check passed.
  - `obs`: The observed value related to the check.
  - `expected`: The expected calue related to the check.
  - `note`: A brief description of the test.

### Two modes of testing

Testing can be performed in one of two ways:

* Bulk testing
* Individual testing

Bulk testing loads the test spec file and checks all the tests listed therein.

Individual testing takes a single specification and runs all the checks
associated with that specification producing detailed output for each check.

## Bulk testing

```{r}
test_spec <- read_test_spec_file(pipeline_dir = pipeline_dir)
all_test_results <- NULL
for (indx in 1:nrow(test_spec)){
  test_result <-
    conduct_test(c_test_name = test_spec[indx, 'test_name'],
                 fasta_file = test_spec[indx, 'fasta_file'],
                 command_flags = test_spec[indx, 'command_flags'],
                 test_description = test_spec[indx, 'test_description'],
                 pipeline_dir = pipeline_dir)
  all_test_results <- rbind(all_test_results,
    data.frame(test_name = test_result$test_name,
               all_passed = all(test_result$test_result$result),
               n_tests = nrow(test_result$test_result),
               n_passed = sum(test_result$test_result$result))
    )
}
```

A total of `r nrow(all_test_results)` tests were run. Of these tests, `r sum(all_test_results$all_passed)` tests passed.

```{r}
kable(all_test_results,
      caption = 'Summary of all tests results')
```

## Individual tests

### Description of pipeline flags

* `opt_D` means print debugging output.
* `opt_o` is an optional directory to put the output; default depends on input filename.
* `opt_O` is just like opt_o.  Same thing.
* `opt_V` means be verbose.
* `opt_C` means skip (do not run) the PhyML diversity or InSites analysis and the primary founder call (which depends on those)
* `opt_P` means skip (do not run) profillic
* `opt_R` means skip (do not run) RAP (alignment-internal recombination detection program)
* `opt_F` means skip (do not run) PFitter
* `opt_E` means skip (do not run) entropy statistics calculation
* `opt_H` means skip (do not run) HYPERMUT 2.0 hypermutation detection
* `opt_f` means fix hypermutated sequences, instead of removing them.
* `opt_w` is what we should fix hypermutated sequences with (default: R)
* `opt_I` means run inSites online (instead of offline)
* `opt_i` is the insites threshold to use for all regions except v3 (default: 0.85).
* `opt_v` is the insites threshold to use for v3 (default: 0.33).
* `opt_T` means don't train the profillic profile, just use the converted alignment directly.
* `opt_r` means recursively operate on clusters identified using the Informtive Sites method.
