I found this on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phyml-forum/yeIwFkwsI8c posted 4/16/2014:

In the function Dist_And_BioNJ (in utilities.c) replace the following block of
instructions:
>>
  Bionj(mat);
  tree      = mat->tree;
  tree->mat = mat;

  return tree;
<<

with
>>
  Bionj(mat);
  tree      = mat->tree;
  tree->mat = mat;
  Print_Mat(mat);

  return tree;
<<

and recompile. That should do the trick.
