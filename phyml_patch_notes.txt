I found this on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/phyml-forum/yeIwFkwsI8c posted 4/16/2014:
[And then I modified it so that the phyml program exits after printing
the matrix and therefore doesn't even create a tree; makes it faster,
and all we need for hiv-founder-id is the matrix.]

In the function Dist_And_BioNJ (in utilities.c) replace the following block of
instructions:
>>
  Bionj(mat);
  tree      = mat->tree;
  tree->mat = mat;

  return tree;
<<

with
>>
  Bionj(mat);
  tree      = mat->tree;
  tree->mat = mat;
  Print_Mat(mat);
  // Paul added this to skip making the tree, just output the distance
  // matrix and exit.  When compiling with this, phyml should be
  // renamed eg to phyml_matrixonly 
  Warn_And_Exit("");

  return tree;
<<

and recompile. That should do the trick.
